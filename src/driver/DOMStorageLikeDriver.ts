     *  This may throw a quota error.

     *  However, in almost case, we cannot handle it correctly when we faceing such error.
     *  Of course, we can remove unnecessary data carefully but it's complex definitedly to handle correctly.
     *  We don't recommend it.
     *  Rather, we recommend to try to clear all data once and try to recover the state from zero.
     *  This includes that show some dialogs to user to clear their storage by user.
     *
     *  Furthermore, for today, we faces a limitation of some privacy enhancements by user-agent
     *  (e.g. Safari's Intelligent Tracking Prevention which will remove a page's all persistent data after some periods).
     *
     *  This suggests these characteristics additionally to traditional security concersn related to client-side storage.
     *
     *      1. We cannot expect that user's storage is long-lived persistecy.
     *         Perhaps, they're just only little longer than sessionStorage.
     *      2. We should think the user's storage would clear accidentally.
     *         Be careful if we store high volatile credentials to them.
     *          - Of course, DOM Storage is not secure to store security credentials!
     *          - We might not be able to recover them even if user call your support.
