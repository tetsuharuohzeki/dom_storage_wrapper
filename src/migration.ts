/**
 *  This function would write a new version after _migrator_ completed.
 *
 *  This is a design choice to consider safety if the application is shutdown
 *  by user-agent by happening somethings during the application is migrating storage.
 *
 *  DOM Storage does not have transaction model.
 *  In practice, we assume that we almost would not face such kind of hazard,
 *  however,  we cannot do safely this kind of migration ultimately.
 *
 *  In other word, **we should not do breaking change storage schema as possible** :(
 *  However, this will not advance this talk. We think this design limitation would lead following rules:
 *
 *      1. The migrator function should ignore the migration of _key A_ if there is no entry for _key _A_.
 *      2. The migrator should clear the old key after success to write a new key.
 *      3. The old key and the new key must not have a same name in consecutive versions.
 *          * If you do breaking change for key _A_ in version _2_,
 *            you must not use the same key name for new entry.
 *            If you do that, the migrator might not do _rule 1_.
 *      4. The migrator should migrate schema only single version at the time.
 *          * This rule is to follow _rule 4_. As a checkpoint, it would should be better write a scheme version one by one.
 *
 *  This design is adhoc but the migratior would get idempotency.
 *
 *  Let's think about the case of that the migrator has these rules.
 *  If your migrator starts its migration on the storage
 *  which almostly was migrated but was not set new version _v2_ from _v1_,
 *  then migrator would run the migration process for _v1_ again.
 *  But this would not do nothing because
 *
 *      1. The migrator does not do anything if there is no old key.
 *      2. Even if there is a old key,  the migrator will migrate it to the new key.
 *      3. If the application happened to shutdown accidentally,
 *         the application would not do other anythings.
 *         We can assume that the storage would not be modified by the new schema.
 *
 *  By these thinking, we also don't write in-migration flag entry.
 *  We cannot also do it transactionally with the version entry.
 *  So we should do write a migrator as idempotency...
